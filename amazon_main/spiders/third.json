I prefer lettuce that\u2019s ready to be used right from the package.\n", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2020", "verified": "Verified Purchase"},

It's fantastic to put in salads, burgers and anything else you would want lettuce. This lettuce is not bitter at all and has a nice richness flavor to it. This is the only one we always buy!\n", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2020", "verified": "Verified Purchase"},

{"name": "o", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n  IMO this is SO much better than the butter lettuce I get from the grocery store. I've gotten it delivered with Amazon Fresh twice and both times it was so fresh and delicious. It remained fresh and tasty the entire 4 days or so it took my daughter and I to eat both boxes. Good purchase.\n", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2020", "verified": "Verified Purchase"},

You pay extra for this lettuce but it's worth it if You are doing something special.  I made three salads with one container.  Served with artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, Kumato tomatoes and grilled chicken - topped with a lemon vinaigrette.\n", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2020", "verified": "Verified Purchase"},
